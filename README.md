# PersonalSiteFeeder
My personal site will be feeded by the content here


I believe I need to follow https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html?highlight=github#user-pages

I will be using https://getpelican.com/ for generating the blog
And I still need to look on how to generate the CV.

Personal information:

I'm generetating the pelican site in my machine with the following command

python -m pelican content
